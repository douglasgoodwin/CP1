# DEBATES

We restage famous debates we are able to wrestle with the arguments that captivated the world at different points in time. Do our eyes shoot rays of light or absorb films emitted by worldly objects? Is light a particle or a wave? Does the color red exist as a physical property or is it produced by our perception? Are digital images photos or data? These are the topics we debated in CP1. 

We use the Australasian Parliamentary English Debate style. This formal method of debate encourages critical thinking, tolerates personal expression. It also works well in a classroom setting. 

We start by splitting the classroom into three parts: Affirmative Team, Oppostion Team, and Judges. Students are assigned to one of the teams arbitrarily. Once assigned they have 45-60 minutes to prepare arguments. The Professor answers questions and ensures that each team is prepared.

Here is an example debate on the nature of light. The Affirmative Team champions Sir Isaac Newton's claim that light is corpuscular. The Opposition is led by Christaan Huygens who used Newton's own writings to show that light is a wave. 

1. Team NEWTON's first speaker gives the affirmative statement: _That light is composed entirely of corpuscles or particles_, outlines the team's arguments, and states why it is logically correct. The first speaker then introduce presenters and delivers the first argument.
2. Team HUYGENS challenges NEWTON's argument. The second speaker rebuts NEWTON's arguments before delivering the first Opposition argument. 
3. NEWTON's second speaker rebuts HUYGEN's argument, restates NEWTON's case, then delivers a second speech and summary of the affirmative position.
4. HUYGENS' second speaker rebuts NEWTON's first two speakers, restates the case, and delivers the Oppostion's second argument.
5. NEWTON's third and final speaker rebuts HUYGEN's two speakers then summarizes the three points of this debate.
6. HUYGENS' last speaker rebuts, restates, and summarizes.
7. The JUDGES now confer, and the first of Two  Responders provide an overview of the debate, identify issues on both sides, and give a _biased response_.
8. The JUDGES winner is determined based on scores for **Matter**, **Manner**, and **Method**.

## Scores

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
