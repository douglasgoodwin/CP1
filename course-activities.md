### Major Learning Activities: â€¨

We will advance through 8 sections relevant to image reception: 

1. Light & Illumination
2. Visual Ecology
3. Perception
4. Images & Propaganda
5. Lenses & Cameras
6. Analog Photography
7. Automatic Image Making
8. Digital Photography

Each section contains lecture/discussion, quick student presentations, in-class activities \(making things with your hands\), and in-class instruction. Students will use Jupyter Notebooks hosted by Google Colab to document lab work and perform light image analysis. We will also have at least four debates recreating famous historical disagreements.

Students will read texts from three books one of which is free and available online. I will supply supplemental texts as PDFs. Projects will be documented on online Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colab. Students will need a Colab account \(Free\).

No previous programming experience required or expected.
