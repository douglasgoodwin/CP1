# Artists and Computer Scientists

### This class draws students from many parts of the 5Cs as it is listed both an art class and a CS elective. I would like to tailor the class to each kind of student by dividing the labs into complementary activities so that each kind of student may focus on his or her wishes and bring that focus to the group activities. 

**Example**. You will build pinhole cameras for the first activity. The first cameras used pinholes, and images produced in this way have unique qualities. 

Determining the optimum size for the pinhole and calculating the optimum focal length are  specialized math problems as is calculating the proper exposure time \(recoprocity failure\).
